# List in C++
***

A program that creates a singly linked linear list, displays it on the screen, frees memory when finished, and performs the following operations on the list elements:
- Write a function that counts the number of words in a list that:
    - begin and end with the same letter;
    - begin with the same letter with which the previous word ends;
    - match the last word.
- checks whether there are at least two identical elements in the list.
